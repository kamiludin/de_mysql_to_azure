# Data Pipeline from MySQL Database to Microsoft Azure

## Introduction

The project aims to demonstrate a comprehensive data pipeline utilizing Azure services, transitioning raw data from MySQL to actionable insights with Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, and Power BI. It showcases loading multiple files efficiently in Azure Data Factory using loops and provides practical application examples using real-world Electric Vehicle Population Data from the Washington State Department of Licensing.
